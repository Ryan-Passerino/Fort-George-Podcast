# The Changing Representations of the Past at Fort George National Heritage Site
By Ryan Passerino

<br>

### Description:
Want to know how an old military fort from the 1800s can be converted into a popular tourist attraction?

Then join me as I give a brief history of Fort George National Heritage Site and how it has changed over time. I go over the site's initial 150-year transformation before examining how it continues to evolve with special guest Dan Laroche, Fort George's Site Supervisor.
<br>
