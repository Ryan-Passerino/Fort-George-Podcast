# Fort George Podcast

A podcast for HIST4840 - Public History, where I located primary documents and researched Fort George National Historic Site, visited Fort George to interview Site Supervisor Dan Laroche, used Audacity to merge interview excerpts and my own narration based on my research, then finally created a website using Github to display it.
